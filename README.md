# XML-Data-Representation-Shopping-Website-
Created a web application for a made up department store that shows how much a customer is saving while taking into consideration the discounts being offered by the store owner.
It is offering 5% discount on shoes, 7% discount on shirts, and 8% on dresses. 
The quantity in the inventory corresponds to all the available sizes and colors, i.e., for example, it has 40 pairs of brown shoes ranging from size 8 up to size 15. 
The Web app shows the total savings when the discounts are included on the sales.
